# Project Title: React Native App with Google OAuth 2.0 and JWT Refresh Token Authentication

## Technologies Used:

- React Native CLI: A command line interface tool that enables building and deploying React Native applications.

- TypeScript: A programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript, making code more predictable and easier to maintain.

- Google OAuth 2.0: A standard protocol that provides secure authorization to access user data from various Google services.

- JWT refresh token: A method of using JSON Web Tokens to authenticate and refresh a user's login session.

- React Redux: A state management library that facilitates managing the state of the React components.

- Firebase: A mobile and web application development platform that offers a suite of services such as database, storage, and authentication.

- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework that provides a fast and comprehensive way to test React components.

- Clean Code Architecture: A software design pattern that promotes writing clean, maintainable code.

By using these technologies, the React Native CLI TypeScript project provides an easy-to-use mobile application with robust authentication features, efficient state management, and reliable testing. The project leverages Firebase's services to manage data and offers an overall scalable and maintainable codebase. The use of TypeScript adds an extra layer of type safety, making the codebase more predictable and reducing potential errors.

## Features:

Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the application using their Google account credentials. This feature is implemented using the Google OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol.

JWT Refresh Token Authentication: The app uses JWT (JSON Web Token) to authenticate users. The refresh token allows the user to stay logged in even if the access token expires. This feature is implemented using a JWT library for React Native.

Login and Signup Functionalities: The app has separate screens for user login and signup. Users can create a new account using their Google account credentials, or they can sign up with a new email and password.

## Development Process:

Setting Up the Development Environment: The React Native CLI and TypeScript were used to develop this app. The development environment was set up by installing the necessary dependencies and tools.

Designing and Implementing UI: The UI was designed using React Native components and styled with CSS. The login and signup screens were created with appropriate input fields, buttons, and error handling.

Implementing Google OAuth 2.0: The app uses Google OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users. The necessary libraries were installed and the authentication flow was implemented using the Google Sign-In API.

Implementing JWT Refresh Token Authentication: The app uses JWT refresh tokens to keep users logged in even if the access token expires. The necessary libraries were installed and the authentication flow was implemented using a JWT library for React Native.

Testing and Deployment: The app was tested on Android platform.

## Conclusion:

This React Native app with Google OAuth 2.0 and JWT refresh token authentication is a robust and secure mobile application. The app allows users to sign up and log in with ease and provides a seamless experience for its users.
