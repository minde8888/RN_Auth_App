# Project Title: React Native App with Google OAuth 2.0 and JWT Refresh Token Authentication

#Technologies Used:

React Native CLI
TypeScript
Overview:
This project is a mobile application developed using React Native CLI and TypeScript. The app has implemented authentication features using Google OAuth 2.0 and a JWT refresh token for login and sign up functionalities on the frontend.

#Features:

Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the application using their Google account credentials. This feature is implemented using the Google OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol.

JWT Refresh Token Authentication: The app uses JWT (JSON Web Token) to authenticate users. The refresh token allows the user to stay logged in even if the access token expires. This feature is implemented using a JWT library for React Native.

Login and Signup Functionalities: The app has separate screens for user login and signup. Users can create a new account using their Google account credentials, or they can sign up with a new email and password.

#Development Process:

Setting Up the Development Environment: The React Native CLI and TypeScript were used to develop this app. The development environment was set up by installing the necessary dependencies and tools.

Designing and Implementing UI: The UI was designed using React Native components and styled with CSS. The login and signup screens were created with appropriate input fields, buttons, and error handling.

Implementing Google OAuth 2.0: The app uses Google OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users. The necessary libraries were installed and the authentication flow was implemented using the Google Sign-In API.

Implementing JWT Refresh Token Authentication: The app uses JWT refresh tokens to keep users logged in even if the access token expires. The necessary libraries were installed and the authentication flow was implemented using a JWT library for React Native.

Testing and Deployment: The app was tested on both iOS and Android platforms. The app was deployed to the app stores using the appropriate tools and processes.

#Conclusion:
This React Native app with Google OAuth 2.0 and JWT refresh token authentication is a robust and secure mobile application. The app allows users to sign up and log in with ease and provides a seamless experience for its users.
